# Address Book System Review:

The code represents a simple address book system allowing users to add, remove, find, and view contacts. Here are some observations and recommendations:
Suggestions for Improvement:

    Variable Naming: Use more descriptive variable names to enhance code readability. For instance, choise should be spelled as choice.

    Input Validation: Implement input validation to handle cases where invalid inputs are provided by users (e.g., non-numeric inputs in a numeric context).

    Error Handling: Add error handling mechanisms for cases like exceeding the array size or when trying to remove a person that doesn't exist.

    Search Functionality: The search method could be improved. Instead of returning a concatenated string of matching contacts, consider returning an array or a more structured format that includes all matching contacts.

    Remove Method: The current implementation of the removePerson method only removes the first found match. To remove all matches, consider modifying the logic to remove all instances of the matched person.

    Enhanced User Interface: Improve the user interface with clear prompts and messages for better user interaction and understanding.

    Use of ArrayList: Consider using ArrayList or a dynamic data structure to store contacts instead of fixed arrays. This would allow for easier addition and removal of contacts without worrying about fixed array sizes.

    Encapsulation: Encapsulate class fields by making them private and providing access through getter and setter methods to control access and maintain data integrity.

    Handling Duplicates: Implement a mechanism to handle duplicate entries in the address book.

    Comments and Documentation: Add comments to the code to explain complex logic or provide clarity on specific functionalities.

Code Organization:

    The code structure is generally clear, with appropriate division into classes and methods.
    It lacks exception handling mechanisms for potential errors during runtime (e.g., null pointer exceptions).
    Consider breaking down complex functionalities into smaller, more manageable methods to improve readability and maintainability.
